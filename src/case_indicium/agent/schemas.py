from __future__ import annotations

"""
Typed data models used across the SRAG agent.

These Pydantic schemas define the contract between:
- the ELT/gold layer and the web app,
- the agent tools (NLâ†’SQL, reporting, news fetching) and the UI,
- and the report generation pipeline.

Compatibility note:
  Field names and shapes were kept the same as the original PT-BR version
  so callers do not need to change. Only docstrings/descriptions were added
  and types annotated more explicitly where helpful.
